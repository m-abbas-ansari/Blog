Another engineering undergrad thinking of doing something meaningful with his life :D

Studying BTech Computer Engineering at NAAC A++, top-rated, top class and a university at par with MIT known as Jamia Millia Islamia. I spend most of my time either working on Deep Learning projects or procrastinating towards them. I try to make the best out of my procrastination stints by watching random lectures or podcasts on youtube to satiate my curiosity.

I'm aspiring to make the next Skynet and merge my consciousness with the machines to rule the world (I'll rename it to Haskul).
