# The first year: New Beginnings.

_This entry is for the purpose of journalling the progress made from Nov 2020 to Dec 2021. Beginners who are thinking of breaking into the field of Deep Learning may find something useful here._

Let me set the scene here: I took a study gap of a year after my 12th to prepare for JEE and got enough to get BTech CS at JMI. I drove to Delhi in the last week of October 2020 to complete the admission procedure in JMI. From my JEE exam in Jan 2020 to October 2020, I had given up studying anything related to science or engineering. It was an interesting period in which I spent most of the time learning Arabic, Islamic history, Qur'an and getting into Sufi mysticism. I returned home in mid-November 2020, realizing that I must start focusing on my career rather than just focusing on the afterlife.

Before November 2020, I had learned C++, HTML and CSS as part of my studies in school. I never did coding as a hobby and never explored outside of what was taught in school. I can't say I regret it since my priorities were different than now (i.e. becoming a politician xD).

### Harvard CS50 \[Nov'20-Dec'20]
So to refresh my coding concepts and try to code with intent rather than to clear exams, I decided to start the [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) course. I watched the lectures diligently, went through their notes, and solved the programming assignments. It was one of the most thrilling experiences I've ever had until that point and solving coding challenges reminded me of the dopamine rush I used to get when solving Physics problems from HC Verma. Unfortunately, I didn't complete the whole course. I didn't continue it after solving python assignments. 

So the things I got out of CS50 were:
1. An understanding of the C programming language.
2. Intro to basic data structures and algorithms.
3.  First experience with python and SQL.
4.  Some very basic ideas about web development.

In hindsight, I should have completed the whole course to completion i.e. worked on web projects. From the beginning, I have shied away from making deployable projects or being creative in writing my code for fun. I could maybe blame the preparation for JEE for inhibiting my tinkering capabilities. Learning to code is not learning syntax and concepts. I feel one must have fun with the code, be creative and brainstorm cool little projects.
