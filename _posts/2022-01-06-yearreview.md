# The first 40 days.

_This entry is for  journalling the progress made from the end of Nov 2020 to the end of Dec 2020. Beginners who are thinking of breaking into the field of Software development or Deep Learning may find something useful here._

Let me set the scene here: I took a study gap of a year after my 12th to prepare for JEE and got enough to get BTech CS at JMI. I drove to Delhi in the last week of October 2020 to complete the admission procedure in JMI. From my JEE exam in Jan 2020 to October 2020, I had given up studying anything related to science or engineering. It was an interesting period in which I spent most of the time learning Arabic, Islamic history, Qur'an and getting into Sufi mysticism. I returned home in mid-November 2020, realizing that I must start focusing on my career rather than just focusing on the afterlife.

Before November 2020, I had learned C++, HTML and CSS as part of my studies in school. I never did coding as a hobby and never explored outside of what was taught in school. I can't say I regret it since my priorities were different in the past (i.e. becoming a politician xD).

### Harvard CS50 \[Nov'20-Dec'20]
So to refresh my coding concepts and try to code with intent rather than to clear exams, I decided to start the [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) course. I watched the lectures diligently, went through their notes, and solved the programming assignments. It was one of the most thrilling experiences I've ever had until that point and solving coding challenges reminded me of the dopamine rush I used to get when solving Physics problems from HC Verma. Unfortunately, I didn't complete the whole course. I didn't continue it after solving python assignments. 

What I gained from CS50:
1. An understanding of the C programming language.
2. Intro to basic data structures and algorithms.
3.  First experience with python and SQL.
4.  Some very basic ideas about web development.

In hindsight, I should have completed the whole course i.e. worked on web projects. From the beginning, I have shied away from making deployable projects or being creative in writing my code for fun. I could maybe blame the preparation for JEE for inhibiting my tinkering capabilities. Learning to code is not learning syntax and concepts. I feel one must have fun with the code, be creative and brainstorm cool little projects. I wasn't creative, thus thought that software development was not for me.

### Dec 2020: A time of confusion/exploration

I wanted to learn about AI since 11th grade. The reason I chose to do computer science was to invent an AGI (artificially generally intelligent) system. This greater ambition of mine still holds as of now. Back then, I had no clue how to pursue this goal. I took the first lecture on [CS50 AI](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/) and quickly realized that my python skills were just not up to the mark to do the course. _In hindsight, if I would have been tenacious and stuck with the course, my python skills might have improved. You must get out of your comfort zone as quickly as possible to learn effectively_.

Therefore, I got overwhelmed with jumping into AI directly and thought that I should master CS fundamentals before doing AI. There is certainly a term for this kind of thinking somewhere, where you prevent yourself from doing what you enjoy just because you don't know the first principles of how to do it. Someone might stop themselves from doing web development just because they don't know how computer networks work fundamentally. Then they'll prevent themselves from learning computer networks since they don't know how does a computer even work in the first place. In the search for "first principles", you can go from trying to develop a cute little website to learning about the internet, computer networks, computer architecture, digital logic, electronic circuits, electrical circuits, the nature of the electron, quantum physics, and to trying to understand the meaning of reality itself.\[I'll probably write more about this in a later blog]

The attempt at understanding CS fundamentals began with Mathematics for Computer Science [MIT 6.042J](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ&list=PLB7540DEDD482705B). I learned:
1. Different methods of proof and Induction. 
2. Number Theory and Cryptography.
3. Basic idea about graph colouring. \[_I stopped here_]

I also began trying to understand data structures from platforms like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/). I watched many guidance videos on how to get started with competitive programming (cp) and was engulfed in the rat race of cp for a moment. Even had ambitions to compete in ICPC, but it all came crashing when I joined my first timed competition on CodeChef. I could only solve the first two basic questions and had no clue how to do others. Here I faced another setback to my ego, which again scared me away from not diving into CP.

By around the New year of 2021, I had tried my hand at different areas of CS and seemingly got overwhelmed with most of them.
1. _Tried getting into web development_: uncreativity stopped me from building projects and having fun. 
2. _Tried mathematics of CS_: Had quite a lot of fun with it, and still fascinated with it.
3. _Tried CP_: realized that cp is not as easy as I thought, and gave up on it.

Here is an analogy to summarize December 2020: 
You see a lake and can only see its surface. It looks beautiful and beckons you to dive into it. Donning your swimming shorts, you run with exhilaration towards the lake. You're swimming in the shallows of the lake, having fun you've never had before. It motivates you to take a big breath and dive deep. You're convinced that you'll touch the bed of the lake in no time. You're going down, and down and down... but realize you're out of breath and that the lake can't be explored in one single dive. You swim back to the surface, disheartened and overwhelmed with the depth of the lake. As you swim out, you see in the distance another lake equally or more beautiful than the current one. And the cycle is repeated.

From the psychological perspective, I essentially went through the first stage of the Dunning-Kruger effect multiple times.

You underestimate the effort it will take to master a field and overestimate your competency initially. But soon as you start moving towards the valley of despair, you've understood the vastness of the field and how little you know. As a beginner, this is one of the most difficult things to pass through. I still think I'm in the valley of despair when it comes to deep learning after doing it for a whole year, but I've learned to become comfortable with it. It certainly takes a lot more time than a few months to master a skill.

I had a choice on how I can spend 2021. I could keep exploring multiple things and keep bailing as soon as I found it difficult. Or I could choose one single thing and stick with it till the end. I chose the latter. I decided that I shall focus on mastering Machine Learning before all else and started with Andrew Ng's [Stanford ML course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Here I began my journey into the world where machines can learn themselves with the hope that this technique would be the key to achieving AGI.
