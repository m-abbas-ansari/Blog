# Gradient Ascent 

_This entry journals the initial substantial progress made in the direction of demystifying machine learning starting from January 2021._

Suppose you want to accomplish something that no one has achieved yet. It is like scaling a cliff whose peaks are obscured behind dark clouds. Many have trekked up to different heights. They've taken different treacherous paths. Some proclaim to know the way and keep fantasizing that we'll reach the peak just after we trek this little curb. It is just right around the corner!

You find yourself in the town below the cliff. In the hustle-bustle, you find some young, a bit wiser, folk who've scaled some distance up to the mountain. Some of them are enthusiastic to share the path they've taken, however minor their progress might have been. Some prefer to conceal their secret trails. They've all taken different routes, but you don't have all the time in the world. You can only heed the advice of the one you felt knew what they were talking about, the initial step, all on your gut feeling.
